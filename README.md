## React Fundamentals

This project leverages several core React concepts and hooks to manage routing, navigation, and state efficiently. Below is a list of the primary React features used in this project:

- **Routes**: Utilized to define different paths in the application, allowing users to navigate between different pages or views.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Enables handling parameters in routes, making it possible to load content dynamically based on the URL (e.g., `/product/:id`).
- **Context API**: Used for state management, allowing data to be shared across components without passing props manually at every level.
- **useNavigate Hook**: A React Router hook that allows programmatic navigation within the app, useful for redirecting users to different pages on specific actions.
- **useLocation Hook**: Provides access to the current location object, helpful for tracking the userâ€™s current route and retrieving route state.
- **React Start Components**: Modular, reusable components that serve as entry points for rendering different parts of the UI.
- **useNavigation**: Used to programmatically control navigation, manage routing, and improve user experience within the application.
